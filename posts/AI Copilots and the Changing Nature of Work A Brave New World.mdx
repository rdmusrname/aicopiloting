These new jobs demand  a blend of technical expertise and soft skills, such as critical thinking, problem-solving,  and creativity.

## Navigating the Brave New World of Work

Embracing this new era of AI-powered work requires a concerted effort from individuals, organizations and  policymakers alike. Individuals need to adapt to the changing job market by acquiring new skills and embracing lifelong learning. Organizations must invest in retraining and upskilling their  workforce to ensure they remain competitive in the face of automation. Policymakers need to create policies that support workers displaced by AI and foster an environment that encourages innovation and job creation.

The rise of AI copilots presents both challenges and opportunities for the workforce. By navigating this brave  new world with foresight, adaptability and collaboration, we can harness the power of AI to  create a future of work that is  inclusive,  equitable  and prosperous for all.
